# 🛡️ PhishGuard – Phishing Website Detection Web App

**PhishGuard** is a web-based application that helps users detect and avoid phishing websites. Powered by machine learning, it analyzes URLs and flags suspicious or potentially harmful links in real time. This project aims to raise cybersecurity awareness and prevent users from falling victim to online fraud.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Phishing URL Detection** – Classifies URLs as legitimate or phishing using ML models
* 📊 **Feature Analysis** – Considers multiple features like domain age, URL length, protocol usage, and keyword patterns
* ⚙️ **Real-time Feedback** – Instantly alerts users if a website seems suspicious
* 🌐 **User-Friendly Interface** – Clean, responsive frontend for easy use
* 🧠 **Machine Learning Backend** – Trained on labeled phishing and legitimate URL datasets

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or plain depending on your implementation)
* **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js
* **ML Model**: Trained with Scikit-learn or TensorFlow
* **Database**: MongoDB (optional, for logging or historical data)
* **Deployment**: (e.g., Render, Heroku, Vercel)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PhishGuard.git
cd PhishGuard

# Install dependencies
npm install   # For frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt  # For backend (Python)

# Start the development server
npm start     # Frontend
python app.py # or flask run / node server.js for backend
```

## 🤖 How It Works

1. User enters a URL in the input field.
2. The backend extracts relevant features from the URL.
3. The trained machine learning model classifies the input as "Legitimate" or "Phishing".
4. The result is displayed to the user with a warning or confirmation.

## ✅ Future Enhancements

* Browser extension for real-time URL scanning
* Model retraining on live phishing datasets
* Integration with threat intelligence APIs (e.g., VirusTotal, PhishTank)
* Real-time monitoring and reporting dashboard
